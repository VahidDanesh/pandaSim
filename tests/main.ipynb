    "# Franka Robot Grasping Tutorial: With and Without Spinning Pads\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a comparison between two Franka Emika Panda robots—one with spinning pads and one without—performing the same grasping task. The spinning pads reduce the torsional friction about the normal vector of the contact between robot's finger and the object. \n",
    "\"The implementation for friction in genesis is not as advanced that in Mujoco. There is only 1 scalar parameter in Genesis, and condim cannot be changed (only condim = 3 is implemented). There is no torsional friction at the moment. The torsional friction in genesis is the result of multi-contact friction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard robot uses joints 0-8, with 0-6 for arm movement and 7-8 for the gripper. The modified robot includes spinning pads at joints 9-10, which can help provide rotational slippage at the contact point"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated the difference between standard Franka grippers and those equipped with spinning pads. Key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup Complexity**: The spinning pad configuration requires additional DOFs (9-10) but provides enhanced manipulation capabilities\n",
    "2. **Grasp Stability**: Spinning pads can improve stability by providing rolling contact instead of sliding contact\n",
    "3. **Object Control**: During transport, the spinning pads help maintain more precise control of the object\n",
    "\n",
    "For applications requiring precise manipulation or handling of delicate objects, the spinning pad configuration offers significant advantages despite the added complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**:\n",
    "- Try manipulating objects of different shapes and materials\n",
    "- Experiment with different spinning pad velocities\n",
    "- Implement closed-loop control using force feedback from the gripper\n"
